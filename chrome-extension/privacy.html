      <p>
        Perspective Prism ("we", "our", or "the Extension") is committed to
        protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, how
        we use it, and your rights regarding your information.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        We collect the minimum amount of data necessary to provide our video
        analysis service:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Video ID:</strong> When you explicitly request an analysis, we
          transmit the YouTube Video ID to our backend server.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Browsing History:</strong> We do NOT track your browsing
          history, search queries, or activity on other websites.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do NOT collect your name,
          email address, IP address, or YouTube account details.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
      <p>The Video ID is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To retrieve the video transcript and metadata from YouTube.</li>
        <li>
          To perform claim extraction and perspective analysis using our AI
          models.
        </li>
        <li>
          To cache the analysis results locally in your browser for faster
          future access.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Local Storage:</strong> Analysis results are cached locally in
          your browser via <code>chrome.storage.local</code> for 24 hours to
          improve performance. You can clear this cache at any time in the
          extension settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Backend Data Retention Policy:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Logging:</strong> The backend server may temporarily log
              requests (including Video IDs) for debugging, performance
              monitoring, and analytics purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Retention Period:</strong> The retention period for these
              logs varies depending on the backend implementation. If you are
              using a third-party backend, their specific retention policies
              apply.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Recommendation:</strong> For maximum privacy, we recommend
              configuring your self-hosted backend to minimize or disable data
              retention.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Third-Party Backends:</strong> If you choose to use a
              third-party backend, you are responsible for reviewing and
              accepting their data retention policies.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p></p>

      <h2>5. User Data Deletion</h2>
      <p>
        You have the right to request the deletion of your data. However, please
        note that the Extension itself cannot directly delete data stored on the
        backend server.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Self-Hosted Backend:</strong> If you host your own backend,
          you have full control over your data and can delete logs or database
          entries directly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Third-Party Backend:</strong> If you use a third-party
          backend, you must contact the backend administrator to request data
          deletion.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Data Deletion Request Template</h3>
      <p>
        You can use the following template to request data deletion from a
        third-party backend administrator:
      </p>
      <div
        style="
          background: #f0f0f0;
          padding: 15px;
          border-radius: 4px;
          font-family: monospace;
          white-space: pre-wrap;
        "
      >
        Subject: Data Deletion Request - Perspective Prism To whom it may
        concern, I am a user of the Perspective Prism Chrome Extension and have
        used your backend service for video analysis. In accordance with
        applicable data privacy laws, I hereby request the deletion of all data
        associated with my usage, including but not limited to: - Server access
        logs containing my IP address. - Any retained Video IDs or analysis
        results linked to my requests. Please confirm when this action has been
        completed. Thank you.
      </div>

      <h2>6. Your Consent</h2>
      <p>
        By using the Extension, you consent to the processing of Video IDs as
        described in this policy. You can revoke your consent at any time in the
        extension settings, which will prevent further analysis and clear all
        locally cached data.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
      <p>
        If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us
