# Product Overview

Perspective Prism is an AI-powered analysis tool that processes YouTube video transcripts to evaluate claims across multiple perspectives. The system extracts claims from videos, retrieves evidence from various sources, and generates comprehensive "truth profiles" that include:

- Multi-perspective analysis (Scientific, Journalistic, Partisan Left/Right)
- Bias and deception detection (logical fallacies, emotional manipulation)
- Confidence scoring and supporting evidence
- Overall assessment per claim

The product emphasizes security with built-in input sanitization to prevent prompt injection attacks and ensure safe LLM interactions.
